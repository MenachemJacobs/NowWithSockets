This project implements a multi-threaded master-slave system designed to handle incoming connections and enable communication through socket connections.
The system is structured with a master node that manages connections and delegates tasks to a pool of slave nodes, each running on multiple threads.
It is highly concurrent and designed for scalability and responsiveness.
